## What is Profanity?

Profanity is a PHP library that allows blocking bad words out of a given string. It currently
blocks more than 2.555 words in different languages. It's very easy to use and can filter a
100 chars string in about 0.0021 seconds!

## Sample Filter

This example is a simple string that is going to be filtered using this library.

```php
$clean_words = Profanity::blocker('My cool string bitch')->filter()

// My cool string *****
```

## Documentation

### Installation

First, require it using composer:

```
composer require consoletvs/profanity
```

#### Laravel

To install it on laravel, simply add the service provider and the alias in ```config/app.php```:

Service Provider:

```php
ConsoleTVs\Profanity\ProfanityServiceProvider::class,
```

Alias (optional):

```php
'Profanity' => ConsoleTVs\Profanity\Facades\Profanity::class,
```

### Usage

#### PHP

```php
$words = 'My bad word bitch';
$clean_words = \ConsoleTVs\Profanity\Builder::blocker($words)->filter();
// My bad word *****

// Filter words only by English and German bad words.
$clean_words = \ConsoleTVs\Profanity\Builder::blocker($words, languages: ['en', 'de'])->filter();
```

#### Laravel

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use ConsoleTVs\Profanity\Facades\Profanity;
// or using the alias:
// use Profanity;

class HomeController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Simple test function.
     *
     * @return string
     */
    public function test()
    {
        $words = 'My bad word bitch';

        return Profanity::blocker($words)->filter();
        // My bad word *****
    }
}
```

### Methods

#### Constructor

-   blocker($text, $blocker = '****', $languages = [])

    Setup the text and the blocker to use.

    *note:* The blocker defaults to ```****```

    *note:* Pass language codes to reduce the list of bad words that are taken into account.  

#### Class Methods

-   strict(true/false)

    Set the strict mode to enabled or disabled. Strict mode replaces the string even if it's not a word:
    assets => (tagged as ass) => ```****```
    Disable to ensure normal usage.
    Defaults to false.

-   strictClean(true/false)

    Set the strict clean mode to enabled or disabled. Strict clean mode ensures the first blocked character is repeated for each bad word character.
    If so, a bad word of length = 3 (ass) will result in a ```***```, instead of the blocker (defaults to ```****```).
    If the blocker is ```-**-``` then the same example as above would produce ```---``` as strict clean true and ```-**-``` as false.
    Defaults to true.

-   clean()

    Returns true if the text have no bad words on it.

-   filter()

    Filters the text with the given blocker.

-   badWords()

    Return the bad words found in the text.

-   text($text)

    Sets the text to filter.

-   blocker($blocker)

    Sets the string that will replace the bad words.

-   dictionary($dictionary)

    Sets the dictionary. If string is provided, it will be treated as a path and will try
    to decode the json contained in the path. If array is provided, it will set the dictionary.

    Example dictionary:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "language": "en",
            "word": "bitch"
        },
        {
            "language": "en",
            "word": "fuck"
        }
    ]
    ```
